crazybot
========

You'll find the code for crazybot here! If you don't know what crazybot is you might want to head over to http://www.eyewire.org/ to find out ;)

Feel free to help out or use the code for your own bot, but keep in mind that I'm usually pretty sloppy with my programming so I can't guarantee it will always work.
If you plan to use the code for your own bot you'll need a compiler with C++11 support to be able to build it. Also, since I work on this using VC++, you'll find the project files for it in here.

I'll try my best to work regularly and keep the bot updated but you might see some periods with no activity. If I'm nowhere to be seen ask the admins/mods on eyewire for my email and drop me a message.

Also, if I'm not lazy and/or people ask about it, I might make a wiki with bot functions and stuff.
